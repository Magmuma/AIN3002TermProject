# Examining the Impact of Dropout on Overfitting in Deep Learning Architectures

this repository contains the codes and resources needed to implement the experiments described in the [project report](AIN3002ProjectReport.pdf).

we conducted a number of separate experiments to test the effectiveness of using dropout on machine learning models to prevent overfitting and improve the validation performance, some over experiments tested out how well dropout compares with other techniques that were previously used to conduct similar tasks
the codes for the experiments are in the codes folder in this repository, the structure of the file is as follows:

- [codes]( /codes/)
   - CIFAR
         -[CIFAR-10](codes/CIFAR/CIFAR_10.ipynb)
         -[CIFAR-100](codes/CIFAR/CIFAR_100.ipynb)
   - DNN vs BNN
         -[DNNvsBNN]( codes/DNNvsBNN/DNNvsBNN.ipynb)
